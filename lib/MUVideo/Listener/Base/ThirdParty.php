     * Listener for the 'get.pending_content' event with registration requests and
     * other submitted data pending approval.
     *
     * When a 'get.pending_content' event is fired, the Users module will respond with the
     * number of registration requests that are pending administrator approval. The number
     * pending may not equal the total number of outstanding registration requests, depending
     * on how the 'moderation_order' module configuration variable is set, and whether e-mail
     * address verification is required.
     * If the 'moderation_order' variable is set to require approval after e-mail verification
     * (and e-mail verification is also required) then the number of pending registration
     * requests will equal the number of registration requested that have completed the
     * verification process but have not yet been approved. For other values of
     * 'moderation_order', the number should equal the number of registration requests that
     * have not yet been approved, without regard to their current e-mail verification state.
     * If moderation of registrations is not enabled, then the value will always be 0.
     * In accordance with the 'get_pending_content' conventions, the count of pending
     * registrations, along with information necessary to access the detailed list, is
     * assemped as a {@link Zikula_Provider_AggregateItem} and added to the event
     * subject's collection.
